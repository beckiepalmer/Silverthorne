                <h2>Common Ladera Ranch Personal Injury Claims</h2>
                <p>Personal injury claims often result in damages. The phrase "damages paid" may be familiar as damages are an award usually in a monetary form. Damages can be either special or general. Special damages are costs that can be measured like hospital bills, earnings lost from being sick or injured, and property damages which are common in traffic personal injury claims. General damages are things that cannot be measured like pain and suffering, emotional suffering, and undue hardships. Although they may not be measurable they are justifiable in many personal injury claims. If the injury is severe enough than the compensation will likely be more than a smaller less severe injury which will not be awarded as much as a more severe injury. A severe injury might be classified as broken severed limbs, bones, brain damage, paralysis, or other injuries that will cause intense physical, emotional, or mental pain. These types of catastrophic injuries often receive the highest personal injury settlements and compensations. Less severe injuries like a minor cut, sprain or other injuries that will heal quickly and will not result in any permanent damage either physically, emotionally, or mental do not often receive a large compensation. In some cases if an individual suffering a work injury and cannot perform their duties for an extended period of time and the employer is the one that was negligent, than the individual filing the personal injury claim can be compensated in the sum of what they would be making if they were working plus other compensations.</p>
